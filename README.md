##### **Why Use Swiftform?**
*Students*

Swiftform removes the need to go to a school office to get a pass for either leaving early, coming late or a uniform pass.

Swiftform enables students to request these passes / forms from their phones and laptops. Students will be able to chose one of the three forms and send a request to their teacher / office.

The teachers or office staff will be able to accept or denie a students request for a form. Students will also be able to view a history of all the forms that they have requested with their date and time aswell if it was accepted or denied.

*Teachers and Staff*

Swiftform enables teachers to accept or denie the requests for forms given by students aswell as search by student and see their form history and show all the forms they have requested in the past.
